1. Building Program:
	There is a make file for the program.  You can use the commands 'make' or 'make all' to 
	build the program.  The executable is named coinchange.
	
2. Running Program:
	You just run the executable, there is no options.  You are prompted to enter the name of 
	a file to read data from.  The file needs to be located in the same directory as the
	executable.  The program uses three algorithms to calculate the lowest number of coins
	need to make change.
	
3. Algorithms
	changeslow - uses recursion, very slow
	changegreedy - uses a greedy algorithm, can give incorrect answers
	changedp - uses dynamic programming, slower than greedy but correct answers
